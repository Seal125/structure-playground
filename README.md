# structure-playground

# I am moving this to codeberg, all updates will be made there :)

because i love thinking about organization 🙂‍↕️

## The intent of this (so i dont forget) is that i want to see what i PERSONALLY feel is the best way to organize and structure files depending on what im doing

_this is mainly going to be where im jotting down thoughts, might move this into another .md file once i have something going_

---

### This will likely have a couple of different frameworks centered around React and maybe Python because im indecisive and wanna do some frontend

- if calling APIs, have a structure around those
- if it's frontend stuff, or styling related, decide a structure for that
- im **aware** that different frameworks have some opinions, but i would like to work around those anyway and see if there's a general consensus no matter the framework

---

### Questions to think about:

- what does optimization of structure look like? how is it done?
- when starting to think of structure, what's the best thought process?
- **if imlpementing structure on an already existing project, how can we go about changing it w/o it being a super giant headache** (please do this once project is established) (as i wrote this i realize it might be dependent of initial structure anyway, so...it might be a hard ask to have it be less of a pain point but i would still like to try) (pretty sure theres already an answer to this but i wanna get it on my own :) )

### Notes

- i am now using nodejs 21, as this seems to be the most stable version for plenty of the frameworks and libraries im using. in other words, i have been naive to think that the latest version works with everything currently;;
- T^T create-react-app is deprecated apparently, so to respect their sunset, i shall look into some other alternatives mentioned here (https://react.dev/blog/2025/02/14/sunsetting-create-react-app)
- i will be using tailwind because i loveeeee how it looks, so this likely means that styling will be either in the html itself, or organized elsewhere - whichever it boils down to, i will be doing my best to create good names for everything at the very least
